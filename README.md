## 3. BUSINESS PROBLEM 
Bliss Shopping Mall, a prominent retail center, is looking to harness data insights to refine its business strategy and maximize profitability. By analyzing key aspects such as revenue trends, customer demographics, payment preferences, and foot traffic patterns, the mall's management can make informed decisions that drive growth and improve customer satisfaction.
This project involves developing an interactive Excel dashboard to provide a comprehensive customer analysis. The dashboard will present visualized insights into:
- Revenue Performance – Identifying trends in sales and profitability across different timeframes.
- Demographics – Understanding customer profiles based on age, gender, and other key characteristics.
- Payment Preferences – Analyzing transaction data to determine preferred payment methods.
- Mall Traffic Insights – Assessing peak shopping hours, foot traffic trends, and customer movement patterns.
  
The insights generated from this analysis will be instrumental in guiding strategic decision-making during the Bliss Shopping Mall board meeting. By leveraging this data, the management team can enhance marketing strategies, improve tenant selection, optimize mall layout, and implement customer-centric initiatives to drive sustainable growth.

## Key Result

Session A: These are to be displayed as a single virtual on your dashboard
1.	**Customer Base Volume:** Quantify the aggregate count of unique customers captured within the dataset.
2.	**Cumulative Revenue Generated: Compute the comprehensive sum of revenue accrued from all transactions.
3.	**Total Units Purchased: Determine the consolidated volume of products ordered across all customer orders.
Session B:
1.	**Revenue Contribution by Age Demographic: Quantify the proportional revenue impact (%) of each defined age cohort relative to total revenue.
2.	**Gender-Based Revenue Distribution: Analyze the percentage share of total revenue attributable to each gender (Female/Male).
3.	**Gender-Specific Customer Segmentation: Calculate the total number of distinct customers categorized by gender.
4.	**Prevalent Payment Method Identification: Determine the payment method with the highest frequency of usage.
5.	**High-Traffic Mall Assessment: Identify the shopping mall with the greatest volume of customer visits.
6.	**Age Cohort Payment Preferences: Evaluate the predominant payment method adopted by customers within each age category.
