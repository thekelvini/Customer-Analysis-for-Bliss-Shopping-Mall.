## 3. BUSINESS PROBLEM 
Bliss Shopping Mall, a prominent retail center, is looking to harness data insights to refine its business strategy and maximize profitability. By analyzing key aspects such as revenue trends, customer demographics, payment preferences, and foot traffic patterns, the mall's management can make informed decisions that drive growth and improve customer satisfaction.
This project involves developing an interactive Excel dashboard to provide a comprehensive customer analysis. The dashboard will present visualized insights into:
- Revenue Performance – Identifying trends in sales and profitability across different timeframes.
- Demographics – Understanding customer profiles based on age, gender, and other key characteristics.
- Payment Preferences – Analyzing transaction data to determine preferred payment methods.
- Mall Traffic Insights – Assessing peak shopping hours, foot traffic trends, and customer movement patterns.
The insights generated from this analysis will be instrumental in guiding strategic decision-making during the Bliss Shopping Mall board meeting. By leveraging this data, the management team can enhance marketing strategies, improve tenant selection, optimize mall layout, and implement customer-centric initiatives to drive sustainable growth.
